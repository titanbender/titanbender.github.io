    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> Hello! Whether you're a New Yorker or live somewhere else, you're now going to become intimately familiar with the traffic dangers of the strets of the Big Apple. We've worked with traffic accident data from the years 2013-2016 and as well as weather data throughout the same period to explore visualizations of different patterns and predictions. Ready? You should be.By the end of presentation, you will be an expert, rivalring the NYPD motorvehicle department. 
    </p>


    <h2>Heatmap of traffic accidents</h2>
    <p>First off, letâ€™s have a look at how the traffic accidents are distributed in NYC. Below is a map of all the 601,313 observations. The darker the color the higher concentration of accidents. As you can see that Midtown Manhatten is the location within the city with the concentrated amount of accidents. Is this because of increased traffic in the region or is it because of the way people drive in the area? This is tough to figure out, unless you have access data regarding the data flow. What we've done, however, is allowed you to explore how the observations are spread across the city for each of the years. Click on the map below to taken to the sub page including the visualization.

    <br>

    <h2>Accidents during the day</h2>

    <p>Traffic flow changes during the day. Therefore, it seems obvious to explore if traffic accidents indeed happen more frequently during morning and afternoon traffic. Does this pattern exist for both non-lethal and lethal accidents? Try to explore by hitting the buttons below. If you spend enough time, you might find that certain districts follow specific patterns while other districts behave more randomly. Non-fatal traffic accidents generally occour frequent during the morning up to late afternoon, whereas it decreases drastically. Fatal traffic accidents, on the other hand, are much more evenly distributed throughout the hours of the day. This could be intreprated as even though there is less traffic during the late hours of the day, fatal accidents occur just as frequent because of other factors such as limited visibality, intoxicated drivers, pedestrians or bicyclists that are more prevelant during those hours.

    <h2>Seasonality</h2>

    <p> So we loooked at the specific hours of the day. What about the seasonality over the year? For example does accidents happen more frequently in February than July? Are there certain months that are more dangerous for bicyclists? This time we created a time series to give you the opportunity to explore traffic accidents involving Pedestrians, Cyclists, and Motorists vary 5 New York City Boroughs throughout the year. Here we see a clear pattern for teh aggregated accident data: Accidents happen more frequently during the summer months compared to the winter. However, for pedistrians the risk is almost the same throughout the season. The pattern emerges from the fact that cyclists and motorists follow this trend. What is the reason for this? It's tough to predict. Personally, I would have expected the winter months to be more dangerous as NYC is known for snow and ice during this season. </p>

    <h2>Weather</h2>
    <p>So we brought up weather in the seasonility exploration as we expected more accidents during the winter months, but you can't really argue with data. One explanation that counter the impact of bad weather is the fact that drivers might be more careful during those conditions. To get a sense of whether a rainy day impacts the number of accidents, we've done some data analysis. Below you see a graph displaying number of accidents and the amount of rain on particular days. The graph doesn't show a clear pattern, which is also supported by the fact that the pearson correlation, an indicator of a linear relationsship, is close to 0, which indicates no linear relation.

    <br>

    <h2>K nearest neighbors (KNN)</h2>
    <p> So, if NYC gets a report about an accident is it possible to predict the severity of the accident based on just the geographic location? Using KNN, we're able to create a grid over the city with predictions for each locations. If you're a New Yorker and have a specific route to work every day, this could show some disturbing results. Therefore, the results are saved in a different page, so that we do not disturb your sleep tonight unless you're willing to take the chance. "Pssst - Fear Not". Since non-fatal accidents are overrepresented in the dataset, almost all prediction in the unbalanced dataset are of non-fatal character. However, we've also created a unbalanced calculations with an equal number of non-lethal and lethal data sampled. Don't be too worried when you view this map. It does not represent the real world (Fortuntaly!).

  <h2>Decision Tree</h2>
  <p>So what are the best questions to ask in terms of identifying a lethal accident? To figure this out, we've applied a decision tree to uncover this. Based on the anwer of each question, there are an optimal follow up question to ask. Without giving away too much information, we can tell you that the most important factor is the type of motorvehicle that is involved. So are sportscars one of the sinners? Or is it a different type of vehicle that you should look out for? Again, explore at your own risk by clicking the image below. We sincerely hope that you never have to use this tool for real life situations!</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>
  <p>Thanks for visting our page! Hopefully, you now know a lot more about traffic accidents in NYC. To list some examples: You know which section of New York City where accidents happen most frequently, you know that the summer months are the most dangerous for motorists and cyclists, you know that rain fall doesn't have a significant impact on the number of accidents, you know that vehicle types are the most important in terms of identifying lethal accidents. If you discover any other interesting findings in the data visualizations, please share them with me: mail@johanbender.com </p>
